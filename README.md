![The overview Scrollback wrote for ten saved posts](assets/demo.png)

You save dozens of reels about tools, workflows and tricks, and never look at them again. Scrollback reads them all, the speech and the text on screen, and tells you which ones are worth acting on, for which of your own projects.

It is a Claude Code plugin: one skill that walks Claude through five phases, plus two small scripts for the work that should not burn tokens.

## Start

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add t1mvdploeg/scrollback
/plugin install scrollback@scrollback
```

Then ask *"process my saved Instagram collection AI"*, or run `/scrollback:scrollback`.

You need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Collecting links by scrolling needs [Claude in Chrome](https://claude.com/chrome); pasting links works without it.

## What you get

| File | What is in it |
| --- | --- |
| `items/<id>.md` | One note per post: what is explained, every tool, repo and link mentioned, the core claim, and how useful it really is. Posts that show a site or app also get a **Design** section: colours, type, layout, effects, and the likely libraries, marked as seen on screen or guessed from the look |
| `domains/*.md` | Posts grouped by topic, the best source picked where posts overlap, and which tip fits which of your projects |
| `OVERVIEW.md` | **Do these first** (the actions with the most value for you), **Skill ideas** (skills worth building from what you saved), and what stood out |
| `STYLE.md` | The style your saved designs have in common, the distinct looks that come back within it (say, a run of Apple-like product pages), the libraries that keep showing up, and the best examples |

Notes call out what posts like to hide: a link behind "comment X", undisclosed promotion, a transcript that is just music. Scrollback remembers which collections you chose, so later "add my newly saved posts" is enough, and only the new ones are processed.

## How it works

```

1. **Profile.** Claude reads your projects folder (READMEs, manifests, last commit), your `CLAUDE.md` and memory files, and your installed skills and plugins. You confirm the result.
2. **Links.** Claude scrolls your saved collection in Chrome, or you paste links.
3. **Fetch.** Each post is downloaded, its speech transcribed locally, and its frames laid out as contact sheets, because names and commands are often only on screen.
4. **Notes.** Subagents read caption, transcript and frames and write one note per post.
5. **Synthesis.** Claude groups the notes, judges overlap, ties tips to your projects, and `check.py` verifies that every post sits in exactly one domain and every link works.

The first time, Claude asks where the knowledge base should live and remembers the answer in `~/.scrollback`; every later run adds to that same folder. Everything stays on your machine.

## Browse it in a web app

A small local web app shows your knowledge base: overview, posts with search and filters, one page per note, your style, and a form to add links. It needs nothing beyond uv and runs only on your machine.

```
uv run webapp/server.py <kb-folder>     # your knowledge base
uv run webapp/server.py --demo          # a made-up one, to look around
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8720. Adding links writes to `links.tsv`; processing them is still done by the skill (ask Claude Code to add your newly saved posts).

## What it does not do

- It does not install or test the tools mentioned in posts. "Winner" means the best source, not the proven best tool.
- It does not publish anything. The `raw/` folder holds other people's videos; keep it to yourself.
- It does not log in for you. Posts that need a login use your browser's cookies, and only after you agree.
- It does not build the suggested skills unless you ask.

## Tests

```
uv run --no-project --with pytest pytest
```

The tests cover the scripts (link parsing, captions, transcripts, interrupted downloads, the knowledge base check) and guard the repo against private paths. They do not download anything. CI runs them on Windows, macOS and Linux.
